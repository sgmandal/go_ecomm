create a gin microservice with following requirements:
1. take the topic as currency value same as building microservices with go, implement middleware(topic change: make an ecommerce website or the backend)
2. use protobufs to get actual value of currencies
3. after the whole thing is made, implement it to docker
4. try and use mysql, i.e., try and implement gorm framework and merge todos and this project for just the sake of learning
5. after docker, learn and implement kubernetes to it

1. search for ecommerce project or api on golang/other languages // got a medium.com(gorilla mux) and git repo(gin and gorm), and guide to golang ecommerce which seems bit different
2. install xampp on linux and try that code of gin project which was written before(another_gin_project) // done and mysql connectivity working

task :- recreate the medium.com project using gin and gorm for mysql(object relational mapping, an easy way to use packages to store in go's case a struct into the sql database without writing complex queries)
task 1: recreate the same project, understand every aspect of it, and then make the understood changes using gin and gorm
